##pygame小游戏

##Starpusher 
is a game in which a player has to push the given stars on the tiles having starmarks and hence clear the levels.
Since this project is a part of college summer internship, my part in it includes methods like 
**isBlocked** which checks if the given position on the map is blocked or not, 
**drawMap** to draw various game objects on the surface object, 
**isLevelFinished** to check if all the goals are reached and defining 
terminate() and calling main() for the game.
